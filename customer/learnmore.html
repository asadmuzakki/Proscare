         <h3>Home Health Care</h3>
         <p>As a senior's needs increase, in-home care plans can be updated to provide increasing levels of care. Caregivers can also provide supportive services in an independent retirement community or assisted living facility to delay the need for a move to a nursing home for as long as safely possible. Non-medical in-home care providers provide support with basic tasks, offer companionship and provide personal care; personal care aides, companions and private duty aides cannot provide skilled medical services.</p><br>

         <h3>Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)</h3>
         <p>ADLs are basic tasks required to live independently- most people are used to doing these things in every-day-life regularly and without assistance. Because these tasks are central to independent living, the inability to complete them is a definitive sign that a senior needs some help. To determine the need for assistance at home, doctors, senior care providers and benefit assessors commonly measure the ability to complete 6 specific activities of daily living to figure out how much help is needed. Generally, the need for support with two or three ADLs triggers the start of care, as well as benefits that pay for care services.</p><br>
         
         <h3>What are the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)?</h3><br>
         <h3>Bathing</h3>
         <p>Bathing is a measure of an individual's ability to perform basic hygiene tasks like bathing or showering, brushing their teeth, and accomplishing simple grooming such as combing their hair.</p><br>
         <h3>Eating</h3>
         <p>Eating is a measure of the ability to properly feed oneself. Using adaptive utensils, straws and scoop dishes can facilitate independently feeding oneself.</p><br>
         <h3>Dressing</h3>
         <p>Dressing is a measure of the ability to properly dress and undress oneself. Use of adaptive equipment such as button hooks, dressing sticks and velcro is permitted when measuring independence while dressing.</p><br>
         <h3>Toileting</h3>
         <p>Toileting measures a person's ability to get to and from the toilet and properly clean oneself after voiding.</p><br>
         <h3>Mobility</h3>
         <p>Mobility measures the ability to sit, stand, and walk independently. Durable medical equipment such as walkers, rollators, canes and wheelchairs can be used to support ambulation, however the individual's ability to transfer from the bed or chair to a walker or wheelchair is then used as the measure of independent functioning.</p><br>
         <h3>Continence</h3>
         <p>Continence differs from toileting in that it measures a person's ability to control bladder and bowel functions.</p><br>
         
         <h3>Assessing Functional Abilities</h3>
         <ol style="list-style: circle; list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>Increased confusion</li>
            <li>Increased memory loss</li>
            <li>Poor hygiene</li>
            <li>Monitoring vital signs</li>
            <li>Changes in weight</li>
            <li>Neglected household</li>
            <li>Neglected finances</li>
            <li>Decreased mobility</li>
            <li>Increased falls or bruising</li>
            <li>Behavior changes</li>
            <li>Loneliness, isolation, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities</li>
         </ol><br>
         
         <p>The inability to manage basic physical needs indicates that a senior is no longer safe on their own, and quality of life is likely diminishing.</p><br>

         </ol><br>
            
         <h3>Ask about Caregivers</h3>
         <ol style="list-style: circle; list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>Who will conduct the initial assessment?</li>
            <li>Who will provide and approve the care plan? How often will it be reviewed and updated?</li>

         <h3>How to Pay for In-Home Care</h3>
         <p>There are generally three options when paying for in-home care. Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay, otherwise known as “out of pocket.” The type of care services provided and licensure of the provider determines which method of payment applies.</p><br>
            
         <h3>Medicare</h3>
         <p>Any care that is not medical in nature ie. companion care or homemaker services are not covered by Medicare. Medicare only pays for home health care, and only if a recipient meets all of the following requirements:</p>
